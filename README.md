Glaciers are melting, sea levels are rising, precipitation is decreasing, and wildlife is struggling to keep pace.
It has become clear that humans have caused most of the past centuryâ€™s warming by releasing heat-trapping
gases as we power our modern lives. This global rise in the temperature of the air and oceans is called global
warming.
In this project, we present a comprehensive time series analysis of global warming, its impact on the environment,
and the main countries contributing to this phenomenon. We have considered different datasets: Global
CO2 Concentration, Contributors to Global Temperature Changes, Sea Level, and Precipitation Changes. All
of these datasets were downloaded from Our World in Data1, which provides a variety of datasets for different
tasks.
First, we will analyze how one of the most important greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide, has changed over the
last centuries. Next, we will examine the country contributors and their share in the rise of greenhouse gases,
the sea level trend, and the change in precipitation for contributing countries. For each part, we will present
different time series models, choose the best model according to our selected metrics, and provide the relevant
results for the dataset. Finally, in the last part, we will present a general conclusion based on all the results from
the available datasets.
